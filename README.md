I use this program to run my v71a and custom built rotor with Gpredict.
Built with QT Creator on 18.04 Ubuntu Linux.
*.rad and *.rot config files for defining how it talks to the rotor and radio.

ToDo List:

1)	allow for multiple responses for things such as changing freq.
2)	Auto identify command/response to identify com port
