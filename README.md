I use this program to run my v71a and custom built rotor with Gpredict.
Built with QT Creator on 18.04 Ubuntu Linux.
*.rad and *.rot config files for defining how it talks to the rotor and radio.
UPDATE:  Now I have a config for my new Kenwood TS-2000x radio.  I've added the EXIT
commands to the config, so you can specify things that need to be un-done to return the
radio to normal non-satellite operations.

ToDo List:

1)	allow for multiple responses for things such as changing freq.
2)	Auto identify command/response to identify com port
